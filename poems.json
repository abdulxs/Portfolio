They interpret as they wish\n What they make of it is theirs to choose\n From the moment its light met their eyes\n And the neurons in their brain popped open with words\n The words ceased to be mine\n It became whatever story was told in that shiny corner of their head\n From then on, the piece diverges\n One for them and one for me\n For them, the words draw a pattern on the sand\n Its grains hit close to home\n And it gets especially muddy when it rains\n For me, the texts run in multiple directions\n Like I do when playing football\n Knowing the goal lies at both ends of the pitch\n One for them and one for me."
