      "content": "My fingers write so fast, sometimes I feel like I’m left out, merely observing the speed and joy with which words emerge—sentences both flawed and flawless lining up. Yet, eventually, I join the party to smooth the edges, remove misplaced lettrers, and rewrite the statements borne of this euphoria. I do not mind; we do not mind, for every piece, whether polished or half-baked, is ours to claim. Together, we create, pushing until meanings exhaust and the plot dissolves like sweat stolen by cold air. Still, we write, drawing from what feels like endless pools of creativity. If you’re still here, reading this reckless exercise, you have my gratitude. No proofreading will follow; this is a tribute to my fingers—tireless, strong, and long—the pen that was never titled, the ink with which I write. Or perhaps it’s my brain? But let’s not lose ourselves in that debate. Forgive me, reader, for this is about nothing anyone would want to read—not even me, the writer. Or is it my fingers, who could never read?"
